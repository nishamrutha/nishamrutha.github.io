  - excerpt: 'My research focuses on disentangling the complexities of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using optical spectroscopy.
  I mainly use spectra from the 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS: 2001-2009), along with modern spectra from ANU 2.3m Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS)
  to compare changes in the Hβ/[OIII] line ratios on a 15-20 year timescale.'

    excerpt: "My PhD project focuses on unraveling the physical distinctions among AGN sub-types and examining 
    their correlations with the orientation of the AGN and host galaxy, the accretion rate of the AGN, and the dust obscuration of the 
    host galaxy. Specifically, my work entails a comprehensive exploration of variations in the Hβ and [OIII] emission line ratios over two epochs.
    By scrutinizing these ratios, I aim to infer the transient properties of AGN."

    excerpt: "While the [OIII] emission line is part of the narrow-line region (NLR) of the AGN, it is also a tracer of the host galaxy
    star formation rate (SFR). This is not expected to change in short timescales. In contrast, the broad H$\beta$ emission line is a tracer of the
    accretion rate of the AGN and is expected to vary in short timescales. Therefore, the ratio of the [OIII] and Hβ emission lines is
    expected to vary on short timescales. However, extreme dis/-appearances of the broad component of the Hβ emission line on timescales as short as
    few months have been found in certain AGN. These are called Changing Look AGN. My [**Honours Thesis**](/assets/docs/Amrutha_Honours_Thesis_2022.pdf) 
    involved identifying CLAGN using lightcurves."
