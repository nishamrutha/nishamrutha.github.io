  AGN and host galaxy orientation, host galaxy dust obscuration, and AGN accretion rate on inferred AGN sub-types.'

    title: "Unserstanding AGN Sub-Types"
    excerpt: "My research focuses on unraveling the physical distinctions among AGN sub-types and examining 
    their correlations with the orientation of the AGN and host galaxy, the accretion rate of the AGN, and the dust obscuration of the 
    host galaxy. Specifically, my work entails a comprehensive exploration of variations in the H$\beta$ and [OIII] emission line ratios.
    By scrutinizing these ratios, I aim to infer the evolutionary properties of AGN."

    title: "Changing Look AGN"
    excerpt: "While the [OIII] emission line is part of the narrow-line region (NLR) of the AGN, it is also a tracer of the host galaxy
    star formation rate (SFR). This is not expected to change in short timescales. In contrast, the broad H$\beta$ emission line is a tracer of the
    accretion rate of the AGN and is expected to vary in short timescales. Therefore, the ratio of the [OIII] and H$\beta$ emission lines is
    expected to vary on short timescales. I am currently working on a project to identify and characterize Changing Look AGN (CLAGN) using
    the [OIII]/H$\beta$ emission line ratio."
