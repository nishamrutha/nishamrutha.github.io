Welcome! I'm Neelesh Amrutha, a passionate researcher in astrophysics. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at
the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mt. Stromlo Observatory, The Australian National University, 
under the guidance of [A/Prof. Christian Wolf](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wolf-c) 
and [Dr. Christopher Onken](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/onken-c) along with my fellow PhD candidate,
[Samuel Lai](https://samlaihei.github.io).

With a background in both Astronomy & Astrophysics and Computer Science, I strive to combine these disciplines to 
unravel the complexities of celestial objects and phenomena. My research focuses on studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
and exploring the effects of orientation, obscuration, and accretion on inferred AGN sub-types.

Outside my research, my fascination with black holes extends to my passion for 3D modeling. I am actively engaged in 
creating captivating visual representations of black holes using [Blender](https://www.blender.org). It allows me to explore and showcase the 
awe-inspiring beauty and intricate nature of these cosmic phenomena.

For more about my research, visit the [**Research**][1] page or have a look at my [**CV**](/assets/docs/CV_2023.pdf).
