Welcome! I'm Neelesh Amrutha, a passionate researcher in astrophysics. I am currently pursuing my PhD at
the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mt. Stromlo Observatory, The Australian National University, 
under the guidance of [A/Prof. Christian Wolf](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wolf-c), [Dr. Christopher Onken](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/onken-c) and
[Prof. Rachel Webster](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14490-rachel-webster).

I study the light from galaxies to understand the restless lives of the supermassive black holes that power them. 
My research focuses on active galactic nuclei: cosmic engines that flicker, flare, and breathe as matter spirals 
into their hearts. I use telescopes, spectra, and time-series analysis to uncover how these black holes grow and 
influence their surroundings.
Beyond the data, I am fascinated by the patterns hidden in chaos, by how noise becomes signal, and how each photon 
carries a trace of something ancient and powerful. 
For me, astronomy is both science and magic, a way of turning light into knowledge!

Outside of research, I love experimenting with 3D modelling and animation in [Blender](https://www.blender.org), 
diving into fantasy worlds, and playing badminton.
